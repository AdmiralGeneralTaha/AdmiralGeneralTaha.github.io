        <h2>What is Muharram?</h2>
        <p>Muharram is the first month in the in the Hijri Islamic calendar. Muharram is     regarded as a sacred month by all Muslims, due to the historical events that took place. The Shia school of thought takes the stance that Muharram is a sad month, due to the crimes that were commited against the household of the Prophet in Muharram of the year 61 Hijri (680 AD), and that these events should be celebrated and mourned every year. On the other side, the Sunni school of thought takes the stance that Muharram has little significance, and that mourning is not reccomended. They do however, reccomend fasting on the day of Ashura, due to their narrations that the Prophet Muhammed (ص) fasted this day upon hearing that it was the day that Prophet Musa was saved from the Pharoah. The month of Muharram is also one of the 4 "Haram"/sacared months in Islam, in which fighting is prohibbited.</p>

        <h2>Who is Imam Hussain?</h2>
        <p>Al Hussain Ibn Ali Ibn Abi Taleb (ع) is the 2nd grandson of the Islamic Prophet (ص), son of his daughter Fatima (ع), and his cousin and son in law the prince of believers Ali ibn Abi Taleb (ع). Imam Hussain (ع) is the 3rd divinely chosen, and infalliable Imam of Shia Islam. Born on the 5th of Shabaan in the 4th year after the Hijra, Imam Hussain (ع) was one of the most beloved of people to Rasoolullah (ص), in which many narrations were recorded, establishing his great status, such as "Hussain is the light guidance, and the ark of salvation", "Hussain is from me and i am from Hussain", "Allah loves those who love Hussain". Even with all these virtues and proofs of his elevated status given by Rasoolullah (ص), only 50 years after the death of the messenger, Imam Hussain (ع) found him self betrayed by Muslim ummah, as he publically denounced the caliphate of the tyrant, Yazid Ibn Muawiyah (ل). Upon receiving many letters from the people of Kufa, expressing their support for Imam Hussain (ع), he and a handful of his family and supporters left Medina, and began a journey towards Kufa. On the way, they were intercepted on the 7th of Muharram by the army of Umar ibn Sa'd (ل), who approached the Imam (ع) with an army of 30,000 soldiers. On the 10th of Muharram, the Imam (ع), and 77 soldiers from his family and supporters were massacred, and their had their women taken captive to Shaam, where the palace of Yazid (ل) was. The message of Imam Hussain (ع) was to stand to oppression, and his voice is echoed throughout history.</p>
